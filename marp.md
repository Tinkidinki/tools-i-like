## Markdown presentation tool best used with VS code

Really good documentation in this repository: [Repo](https://gist.github.com/yhatt/a7d33a306a87ff634df7bb96aab058b5)

I tried using it with vim, didn't seem as smooth. Perhaps it can be integrated though. 
VS-code also has the `paste-image` extension which makes the process extra smooooth. 

I pretty much copy images from the net/ screenshot and paste into presentation very easily.
