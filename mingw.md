# MinGW

MinGW is Minimal GNU for Windows.
Gnu was a software that set out to be an operating system, but for now is a bunch of free softwares that you get with Linux (eg: gnome, g++). MinGW allows you to have those on Windows. 

(When installing, there were a lot of “cross-compiling necessary” installers: be wary of those!
)
