# Vim
## What can I say XD

Note: Find my .vimrc in this repository. I will continuously keep updating it. 

I think the part I like (and should exploit) is the fact that you can be wherever you are in your file, but to go to another place, there can be absolute commands. 

For example (cursor = C)

this C that
O

To go to the beginning of the next line in insert mode, I need to press <Esc>o no matter where I am. To append, I need to press `a`, no matter where I am. I think these can be leveraged, as you can memorize them easily. 

Still need to learn more to understand it fully. 

Favourite commands so far:
o/O
i, shift I
a, shift A

Stuff I learned from the [Missing Semester video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6Q8Na575qc&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=MissingSemester)
Commands I should start using:
w: Keeping skipping forward to beginning of each word
v: Keep skipping backward to beginning of each word
e: Keep skipping forward to end of each word
0: Beginning of line
$: end of line
f<char>, F<char>, t<char>, T<char>
J: 
Super useful command. Join the next line to current line with a space in between. Especially useful to convert functions written over multiple lines to inline functions.
