# Latex

Find Latex templates in the templates folder. 

## Converting presentation made in Latex (Beamer) to ppt. 
Nice tool: https://github.com/ashafaei/pdf2pptx

Use: `./pdf2pptx.sh main.pdf notwide` for standard dimensions ppt.

Works by converting each page to an image and placing it in the ppt.
Trying to open a pdf in LibreOffice does not work well.


## Also, don't remember what my latex-vim setup was:
Good place to start? What is the `\ll` command mapped to?
